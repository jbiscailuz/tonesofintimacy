            <p>Tones of Intimacy seeks to have its users rethink their relationship with intimacy within the realm of physical touch and proximity. By transforming the act of touch and proximity into sounds, users coming in to contact with one another will feel the true weight of their physicality. By examining how different kinds of relationships function in tandem with touch and proximity, we hope to create an experience that facilitates both awareness and a new found appreciation for all kinds of relationships in our lives.</p>

            <p>In the videos shown, pairs of users explore and showcase the interaction of Tones of Intimacy. As they interact with one another, the sounds they generate spark curiosity within the participants, engaging them to continue playing with using both proximity and touch with another. Each pair creates sounds that are unique to them, which are pushed directly to the Tones of Intimacy as soon as the interaction is complete. Allowing participants to locate and listen to their own personalized sound even after leaving the experience itself.</p>
